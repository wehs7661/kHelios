# heliosv1
Helios derives helical parameters from a set of points using geometry, linear algebra and vector analysis.

This software has very simple requirements: 
bash (shell)
fortran compiler (gfortran). If you have a different fortran compiler, you can manually
 edit the install_helios.sh script to suit.

To install this software, simply type:

bash install_helios.sh
