# kHelios
This repository is mainly for maintaining the notes for the software kHelios developed by Dr. Coutsias from Stony Brook University. 

kHelios derives helical parameters from a set of points using geometry, linear algebra and vector analysis. (Ref: [Characterization of Biomolecular Helices and Their Complementarity
Using Geometric Analysis](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00721).)

This software requires bash (shell) and fortran compiler (gfortran). If you have a different fortran compiler, you can manually edit `install_helios.sh` to suit.

To install this software, simply type:
```
bash install_helios.sh
```
